Vehicle Detection using Yolo
The goal is to detect and draw squares around cars. I used a YOLO image detection network to predict the boxes and labels that I put on the image. I also choose to implement it in Keras because it's accessable and makes small.

TRAIN I don't have a big deep learning computer so even with the tiny-YOLO I need to either use a cpu so it gets stored in RAM or use pre trained weights, training the model on the VOC2012 Dataset
